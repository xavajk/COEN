Step 5: 
- After connecting to gaia.cs.umass.edu, and entering the GET and Host, a lot of HTML code shows in the terminal
- the name of the file that is being retrieved is /kurose_ross/interactive/index.php
- the client is running HTML 1.1
- could not find images within HTML, unclear what formats of text are used

Step 6:
- connecting to a host using 80 as the ports, telnet host 80, works as in Step 5
- other ports tried:
    - 23 gets no response and the process had to be terminated
    - 3389 gets no response and the process had to be terminated
    - 178 gets no response and the process had to be terminated
    - all cases: Operation timed out...No route to host...Unable to connect to remote host
